How to generate an access token

1. Go to the Zoho Developer Console and sign in with your Zoho account credentials.
2. Create a new client by clicking on the "Add Client" button and selecting "Server-based Application" as the client type.
3. Fill in the details for your client, including the name, website, and redirect URI.
4. Click on the "Create" button to create your client.
5. After your client is created, you will be redirected to the client details page. Here, you can find your client ID and client secret.
6. Click on the "Generate" button next to "Auth Tokens" to generate your access token and refresh token.
7. You will be prompted to authorize your client to access your ZohoCRM account. Click on the "Accept" button to authorize your client.
8. Your access token and refresh token will be displayed on the screen. Copy these tokens and store them securely, as they will be required to make API requests to ZohoCRM.

Note: The access token is valid for 1 hour, after which it will expire.
You can use the refresh token to generate a new access token when the current access token expires.
This should be done in the PHP controller please check zoho docs for generating token using refresh token.
