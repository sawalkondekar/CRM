Round-Robin assignment of records
Right now, the solution allows you to auto-assign leads from web form and imported lists. Let us look at a need where you want to auto-assign leads from in-bound calls in a round-robin method, across modules.

Prerequisite: You must create a permanent record in the specific module, leads in this case and assign that record to the first user in round-robin.

Here’s how you add this function to your CRM account:

Go to Setup > Automations > Actions > Functions > Configure Function > Write your own.
Enter the name of the function. For example: “Round-robin assignment”.
Select the module as Leads. Add a description(optional).
Copy the code given below.
Click “Edit arguments”.
Enter the name as “leadId” and select the value as “Lead Id”.
Click Save & Execute Script.
Save the changes.
As you have created a permanent record, this function does the assignment on a round-robin basis without errors. Note that the function won’t work if you don’t create a permanent record .

The Code:


firstRefRecordDetails = zoho.crm.getRecordById("Leads", xxxxxxxxxxxxx);
firstOwner = ifnull(firstRefRecordDetails.get("Owner"),"").get("id");
if (firstOwner = "User_ID_1")
{
UpOwner = "User_ID_2";
}
if (firstOwner = "User_ID_2")
{
UpOwner = "User_ID_1";
}
updatefirstRef = zoho.crm.update("Leads", "xxxxxxxxxxx".toLong(), { "Owner" : UpOwner.toLong() });
info updatefirstRef;
mp = map();
mp.put("Owner", UpOwner.toLong());
updateResp = zoho.crm.update("Leads", leadId.toLong(), mp);
info mp;
info updateResp;
Note:

Replace 'xxxxxxxxxx' with the permanent record id mentioned in the pre-requisite.
The above code is an example for assigning the records in the Leads module. You can use this code for any other module by changing the module name and parameters.
Assigning to a user requires the User ID and not the user name. The user ID is found in the Setup page of your CRM. Take a look at the screenshot below for more details.
The code is zoho.crm._getRecordById for Version 1.0 of APIs.
